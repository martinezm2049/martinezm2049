## Chamberlain Alerts: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Chamberlain Alerts app, exclusively for Chamberlain Group employees!

This is an in-house Flutter app developed by Miguel Martinez for Chamberlain Group. The source code is not available to the public since the app is strictly for use within the organization. The app is available in the Play Store to select users.

This is a simple app that allows users to receive alerts concerning issues related to work within Chamberlain. Due to its simplicity and strict use context, this app does not collect any personal data. Any data transmitted or received within the app, is stored in the user's device storage. Any stored data can be deleted within the app, through the app settings or by uninstalling the app.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

There is only one permission defined in the app's AndroidManifest.xml file. The permission is "android.permision.INTERNET". This permission is required so that the application can receive and send data through the internet, which is the app's main function. Besides that, depending on the Android OS version installed on the user's device the user may also be asked permission to allow the app to use notifications. This is also integral to the app's main funcionality. These are the only permissions required by this application.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Miguel Martinez.
